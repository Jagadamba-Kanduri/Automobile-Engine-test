Aanalyticalmodel for testing new Engine designs

This data is simplified and anonymized version of real automobile engine test data. A leading car manufacturer is designing an automobile engine. It is required by law and regulations, that a given engine configuration is goes through rigorous engine bench test before it is passed for production. Each bench test is an expensive, noisy and time consuming process. Instead the manufacturer would like to use some previous data on various configurations tested and determine through analytics model if their new design will pass or not. This will help them narrow down only few configurations for further testing on physical bench test. 

Done preprocessing and data analysis using R

Models used: Logistic,Decesion tree,Random Forest and applied stacking on predictions.
Used logistic regression as a meta learner.
